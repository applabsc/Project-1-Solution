For this project we're going to be building a login screen, which will serve as a good way to apply what we've learned about components, styling and flexbox. 



Additionally, when we start building apps in the last part of the semester, this project  might prove to be useful, as many apps will need login and account functionalities. 



The task here is to build a login screen with username/email and password fields, and a sign-in button at the very least. For inspiration for designing the login screen, look at sample screens below.

Additionally, linked below is a sample project which lays out an Applab themed login screen. You can to this you get stuck, but do try to complete as much as possible and get help before looking at the example code.
